Our goal is to unite the Church through crowd sourced service.
</p>
<br>
<i><h3>The Church:</h3></i>
<br>
<p>
Christ called for his Church to be one. Theres a lot the church disagrees on today... loving those around us is not one of them. We're more effective as a body. Each of us is good at things... we want to connect those people with the good work going on in the city.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<i><h3>Crowd Sourced:</h3></i>
<br>
<p>
Hands and feet. Some to this and some to that. Strength in numbers, spread that over the city is the most effective way.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<i><h3>Service:</h3></i>
<br>
<p>
All needs you see here are only here because the Church has approved them. Not an open craigslist.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
During the month of May we will be beta testing the idea. We have a handful of downtown Churches committed to giving it a go.










<!-- 
<p>
For the month of May we are going for it. 31 days of churches sharing the good work they are doing so the body can better love its community.
